## Commit 1: Initial commit

This contains the foundation of the backend, everything I need to actually start working on the API has been setup.

- configuring the MariaDB database to the backend
- linking the urls
- configuration of backend done by .env

Setting this all up took a little longer than I initaly thought it would, I had trouble with the installation of MariaDB it had taken me about 3 hours to scan through the log files and fix a configuration issue between the mysql-client and mysql-server.
